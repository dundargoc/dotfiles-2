My public dotfiles.

Feel free to steal whatever you find useful.

Installation
============

    git clone https://github.com/mfussenegger/dotfiles.git

    cd dotfiles
    git submodule update --init --recursive


There is a script that will symlink all necessary files to the home directory::

    ./bootstrap.sh

The script uses GNU stow to create most of the symlinks. Make sure to install
it before calling bootstrap.sh

And another script to remove all symlinks.

BE CAREFUL RUNNING THIS. It uses rm -f! You might delete stuff you wanted to
keep::

    ./clean.sh
